# BUSI 1200 SMG Final Form C Auto-Completer
## Introduction

If you found this, hey, you're probably like me and like to find the easiest way out of things. Well I have the solution for you >:).<br><br>
In the attached Google Sheets document, the stock market game is set up to automatically update on a weekly basis.
<br><br> By entering the "Assignment Start Date" and "Assignment End Date," you can also make up for days you've missed (assuming you found this late).

## Instructions:

#### To properly use the Google Sheet you must:

1. Enter your assignment start and end dates in cells **A7** and **C7**.
2. Enter your stock 'Tickers' in cells **A11** and **C11**.
3. Enter how many shares of that stock you want in cells **B11** and **D11**

Once you complete these three steps the Google Sheet will auto-complete for you.
